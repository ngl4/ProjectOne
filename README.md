# Recipe Search Application

Welcome to [Recipe Search](https://ngl4.github.io/Recipe_App/)! 

## Beginning:

This is the first group project that I worked with three other students in the LPS Coding Bootcamp. After doing some research and going through different recipe websites, I have inserted some additional features for user-friendly purposes. 

## Knowing the Users: 

According to an article, "[Find a Recipe: A User Experience Design Case Study](https://medium.com/@talishapayton/find-a-recipe-a-user-experience-design-case-study-2af080a89ecd)", I discovered more about the type of users who would frequently use recipe search application and their specified needs. These users normally do not cook much. When they use recipes, they always want recipes that are "quick and easy" to make. 

Here are three crucial aspects that users will keep visiting the website:
 * "websites with nice images"
 * "recipes with ingredients they already have on hand"
 * "recipes with minimum steps and ingredients that are quick to make" 

## Introducing the Application: 

For this Recipe Search Application, Here are the features we have: 

### Special Features:
* Search Recipe
    * Search up to three ingredients
    * Have cook/prep time range option
    * Provide relative Youtube videos 
    * Add Liked recipe to your collection 

### APIs Used:
